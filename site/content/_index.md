    heading: Rationale
    text: >
        The Eye care professional in India, specially Optometry and its allied
        professionals, were not regulated and educated in a structured manner until
        28th March 2021, when the Health and allied health commission was passed by
        the parliament .

        The current situation is in a transition phase where a professional now understands that to be licensed they need to upgrade their education as they will now have to prove their competency for the license in the forthcoming regulatory framework. Every student will also have to undergo an exit exam for registration . Not only this the continuing education will become part of the renewal of license and the professional is now liable to the law for any negligence in the eye care delivery. Today’s challenge is the considerable shortage of faculty, trainers and organizations who can cater to this massive upcoming demand.

        LBV intends to help the professionals by bridging this gap and providing education Pan India by blended and online teaching methods. We are bringing in technology, skill and knowledge through experts not only from India but from all over the world.
